## The Core Issue

**Status:** Incomplete integration
**Engine:** RoleInheritanceEngine exists (650 lines, fully tested)
**Problem:** Not connected to token generation
**Fix:** Wire engine to UserService GetUserWithRoles()
**Effort:** 10-17 hours total

## Key Files (By Category)

### Role Inheritance Engine (Don't modify yet)
- `/Users/kaushik/aaa-service/internal/services/groups/role_inheritance_engine.go` (650 lines)
  - Method: `CalculateEffectiveRoles()` ← KEY METHOD
  - Already production-ready
  - Just needs to be called

### Integration Points (Modify these)
- `/Users/kaushik/aaa-service/internal/services/user/service.go` (Injection)
- `/Users/kaushik/aaa-service/internal/services/user/additional_methods.go` (Integration)
- `/Users/kaushik/aaa-service/internal/handlers/auth/auth_handler.go` (Optional)
- `/Users/kaushik/aaa-service/internal/interfaces/interfaces.go` (Optional)

### Current Token Flow (Direct roles only)
- `/Users/kaushik/aaa-service/internal/handlers/auth/auth_handler.go` - LoginV2()
- `/Users/kaushik/aaa-service/internal/services/user/additional_methods.go` - VerifyUserCredentials()
- `/Users/kaushik/aaa-service/internal/repositories/roles/user_role_repository.go` - GetActiveRolesByUserID()

### Group Role Infrastructure (Already complete)
- `/Users/kaushik/aaa-service/internal/entities/models/group_role.go` - Model
- `/Users/kaushik/aaa-service/internal/repositories/groups/group_role_repository.go` - Repository
- `/Users/kaushik/aaa-service/internal/services/groups/group_service.go` - Service

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Review FINDINGS.md
- [ ] Review CODE-LOCATIONS.md
- [ ] Understand RoleInheritanceEngine
- [ ] Plan implementation approach
- [ ] Modify UserService for injection
- [ ] Modify GetUserWithRoles() to use engine
- [ ] Test with hierarchical groups
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Deploy and monitor

## Key Concepts

### Inheritance Type: Bottom-Up Only
- Parent groups inherit roles from child groups
- Not top-down
- Good for: Executives getting subordinate permissions

### Distance-Based Precedence
- 0 = Direct assignment (highest precedence)
- 1 = Child group role
- 2 = Grandchild group role
- Shortest distance wins in conflicts

### EffectiveRole
Contains:
- The role object
- Source group ID/name
- Inheritance path (array of group IDs)
- Distance value
- IsDirectRole flag

## Current Token Flow

```
User Login
  ↓ VerifyUserCredentials
User + Roles (DIRECT ONLY)
  ↓ GetUserWithRoles
User Response with Direct Roles
  ↓ LoginV2 auth handler
  ↓ GenerateAccessTokenWithContext
JWT Token (direct roles only)
```

## Proposed Token Flow

```
User Login
  ↓ VerifyUserCredentials
User + Roles (DIRECT + INHERITED)
  ↓ GetUserWithRoles
  ↓ Call CalculateEffectiveRoles for each org
User Response with Effective Roles
  ↓ LoginV2 auth handler
  ↓ GenerateAccessTokenWithContext
JWT Token (all effective roles)
```

## Questions Quick Answers

**Why this gap?** Engine was implemented as separate module, pending integration

**Production-ready?** YES - fully tested with 3 test files

**Breaking change?** NO - only adds roles, doesn't remove

**Performance impact?** Minimal - uses 5-minute cache

**Code to write?** ~100-200 lines

**Timeline?** 10-17 hours for full implementation

**Risk level?** Low - existing code, tested, rollback-able
