## Key Finding

Your codebase has a **production-ready role inheritance engine that is NOT connected to token generation**.

### The Situation
- Users currently get only **direct roles** in JWT tokens
- A complete **RoleInheritanceEngine** exists (650 lines, fully tested)
- The engine supports **bottom-up inheritance** from group hierarchies
- **Gap:** Engine is not called during auth/token generation

### What Exists
- GroupRole model: ✓
- GroupRole repository: ✓
- Group-role assignment APIs: ✓
- RoleInheritanceEngine: ✓
- Tests for inheritance: ✓

### What's Missing
- Integration into token generation flow: ✗
- Injection into UserService: ✗
- Call to CalculateEffectiveRoles() during auth: ✗

## Quick Start

1. **Review FINDINGS.md** (10 minutes) - Get the overview
2. **Check CODE-LOCATIONS.md** (5 minutes) - Understand where things are
3. **Read role-inheritance-analysis.md** (20 minutes) - Deep dive
4. **Reference quick-reference.md** as needed - Lookup specific items

## Implementation Summary

To enable role inheritance in tokens:

1. **Inject RoleInheritanceEngine into UserService**
   - File: `/Users/kaushik/aaa-service/internal/services/user/service.go`
   - ~10 lines of code

2. **Modify GetUserWithRoles() to use engine**
   - File: `/Users/kaushik/aaa-service/internal/services/user/additional_methods.go`
   - ~50-100 lines of code

3. **Merge direct and inherited roles**
   - Use EffectiveRole.Distance for precedence
   - Return combined effective roles

4. **Update interface (optional)**
   - File: `/Users/kaushik/aaa-service/internal/interfaces/interfaces.go`
   - Add GetUserEffectiveRoles() method

## Current Token Flow

```
User Login → Verify Credentials → Get Roles (DIRECT ONLY) → Generate Token
```

## Proposed Token Flow

```
User Login → Verify Credentials → Get Effective Roles (Direct + Inherited) → Generate Token
```

## Files to Understand

### Core Engine (Don't modify yet)
- `/Users/kaushik/aaa-service/internal/services/groups/role_inheritance_engine.go`
  - Already complete and tested
  - Just needs to be called from auth flow

### Integration Points (Modify these)
- `/Users/kaushik/aaa-service/internal/services/user/service.go` - Injection
- `/Users/kaushik/aaa-service/internal/services/user/additional_methods.go` - Integration
- `/Users/kaushik/aaa-service/internal/handlers/auth/auth_handler.go` - Optional
- `/Users/kaushik/aaa-service/internal/interfaces/interfaces.go` - Optional

## Inheritance Model

**Type:** Bottom-up (Upward) Only
- Parent groups inherit roles from child groups
- Does NOT support top-down inheritance
- Best for: Hierarchical organizations where executives need subordinate permissions

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Is this a breaking change?**
A: No. It only adds roles to tokens, doesn't remove any.

**Q: Will this affect performance?**
A: Minimal impact. The engine uses 5-minute caching.

**Q: How much code needs to be written?**
A: ~100-200 lines for full integration.

**Q: Is the engine production-ready?**
A: Yes. It's fully implemented, tested, and documented.

**Q: Why wasn't it integrated already?**
A: It appears to have been implemented as a separate module pending integration.

## Next Actions

1. Share this analysis with your team
2. Decide if you want to implement role inheritance in tokens
3. Create implementation tasks in `.kiro/specs`
4. Follow the recommended implementation order
5. Test thoroughly with hierarchical group structures
