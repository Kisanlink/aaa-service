# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AAA Service currently returns API responses with redundant data structures, multiple user_id fields, and inconsistent data organization. This creates confusion for API consumers, increases response payload sizes, and makes the API harder to use effectively. This feature will optimize API responses by eliminating redundancy, standardizing field naming, and creating a cleaner, more intuitive response structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent field naming conventions across all endpoints, so that I can write reliable parsing logic without handling multiple naming variations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API endpoint returns data THEN all field names SHALL use consistent casing (snake_case for JSON responses)
2. WHEN the same field appears in different endpoints THEN it SHALL have identical naming (user_id, not UserID vs user_id)
3. WHEN nested objects contain foreign keys THEN they SHALL follow the same naming pattern as top-level fields
4. WHEN API responses are generated THEN field naming SHALL be consistent regardless of the ORM or database column naming

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent and non-redundant response structures, so that I can easily parse and use the data without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API endpoint returns user role data THEN the response SHALL contain only one user_id field at the appropriate level
2. WHEN nested objects are included THEN they SHALL NOT duplicate parent-level information
3. WHEN response contains relational data THEN it SHALL follow a consistent nesting pattern across all endpoints
4. WHEN multiple entities are returned THEN each entity SHALL have a clear, single source of truth for its identifier

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want sensitive fields excluded from API responses, so that confidential data is never accidentally exposed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any endpoint returns user data THEN sensitive fields (password, mpin) SHALL be excluded from the response
2. WHEN user objects are nested in other responses THEN they SHALL NOT contain authentication credentials
3. WHEN API responses include user information THEN only safe, displayable fields SHALL be present
4. WHEN debugging or logging responses THEN no sensitive data SHALL be inadvertently exposed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want predictable response structures, so that I can write reliable data parsing logic without handling multiple variations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any endpoint returns user data THEN the user object SHALL be structured consistently across all endpoints
2. WHEN role information is included THEN it SHALL follow the same structure pattern regardless of the endpoint
3. WHEN nested relationships exist THEN they SHALL use consistent field naming conventions
4. WHEN optional fields are present THEN they SHALL consistently use null instead of empty strings for missing values

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile app developer, I want optimized response payloads, so that my app can load data faster and use less bandwidth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API responses contain nested data THEN redundant fields SHALL be eliminated
2. WHEN relational data is included THEN only necessary fields SHALL be present in nested objects
3. WHEN response size can be reduced THEN unnecessary nesting levels SHALL be flattened
4. WHEN endpoints like GET /users/{id}/roles are called THEN they SHALL return lightweight role assignment data, not full embedded objects

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want consistent data state representation, so that I can understand entity status without ambiguity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entities have soft-delete functionality THEN deleted_at and is_active fields SHALL have consistent logical relationship
2. WHEN an entity is soft-deleted THEN is_active SHALL be false and deleted_at SHALL contain the deletion timestamp
3. WHEN an entity is active THEN is_active SHALL be true and deleted_at SHALL be null
4. WHEN timestamp fields are present THEN they SHALL use consistent timezone representation (preferably UTC)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to validate API response consistency, so that I can ensure data integrity across different endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN response validation SHALL pass for consistent field structures
2. WHEN comparing responses from different endpoints THEN common entities SHALL have identical structures
3. WHEN auditing API responses THEN no duplicate or conflicting data SHALL be present
4. WHEN capturing test evidence THEN HTTP status codes SHALL be explicitly recorded alongside response bodies

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to control the level of detail in responses through query parameters, so that I can optimize data transfer based on my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN I SHALL be able to use query parameters to include or exclude nested relationship data
2. WHEN include_user=true is specified THEN full user details SHALL be included in the response
3. WHEN include_role=true is specified THEN full role details SHALL be included in the response
4. WHEN no include flags are specified THEN only essential identifiers SHALL be returned for nested objects
5. WHEN nested objects are excluded THEN they SHALL be null or omitted entirely, not empty objects

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want clear response transformation rules, so that I can maintain consistency when adding new endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new API responses THEN they SHALL follow documented response structure guidelines
2. WHEN modifying existing responses THEN backward compatibility SHALL be maintained where possible
3. WHEN adding new fields THEN they SHALL follow established naming and nesting conventions
4. WHEN implementing query parameter controls THEN they SHALL follow consistent naming patterns (include*\*, with*\*, etc.)

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want proper authentication validation in API responses, so that invalidated tokens are properly rejected and return appropriate error responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs out THEN their access token SHALL be invalidated and subsequent API calls SHALL return 401 Unauthorized
2. WHEN an invalidated token is used THEN the API SHALL return a consistent 401 error response with appropriate error message
3. WHEN token validation fails THEN the response SHALL include clear error details about the authentication failure
4. WHEN protected endpoints are accessed without valid authentication THEN they SHALL consistently return 401 status codes, not 200 with data

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want user validation endpoints to integrate with Aadhaar verification services, so that users can complete KYC verification through standardized government identity verification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user validation is requested THEN the system SHALL integrate with the aadhaar-verification service for identity verification
2. WHEN Aadhaar OTP is generated THEN the response SHALL follow consistent API response structure with transaction_id and proper error handling
3. WHEN Aadhaar verification is completed THEN user responses SHALL include verification_status with aadhaar_verified flag and verification timestamp
4. WHEN user data is requested with profile_data=true THEN the response SHALL include profile related data
5. WHEN Aadhaar verification data is included THEN sensitive information SHALL be properly masked or excluded for security
6. WHEN verification endpoints are called THEN they SHALL follow the same authentication and response structure patterns as other API endpoints

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to change my password securely, so that I can maintain account security and update my credentials when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to change their password THEN they SHALL provide their current password, new password, and valid authentication token
2. WHEN password change is requested THEN the system SHALL validate the current password before allowing the change
3. WHEN password change is successful THEN the response SHALL follow consistent API structure and confirm the change without exposing sensitive data
4. WHEN password change fails due to incorrect current password THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error response with clear messaging
5. WHEN password is changed THEN all existing refresh tokens for that user SHALL be invalidated for security

### Requirement 13

**User Story:** As a user, I want to reset my password when I forget it, so that I can regain access to my account through a secure verification process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL send an OTP to their verified contact (phone/email) without requiring authentication
2. WHEN password reset OTP is generated THEN the response SHALL follow consistent API structure with transaction_id and expiration details
3. WHEN user provides valid OTP and new password THEN the system SHALL allow password reset and invalidate the OTP
4. WHEN password reset is completed THEN the response SHALL confirm success and all existing tokens for that user SHALL be invalidated
5. WHEN invalid or expired OTP is provided THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error response with clear messaging
6. WHEN password reset endpoints are accessed THEN they SHALL follow the same response structure patterns as other API endpoints
