# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Investigate existing service implementations

  - Check if OrganizationService and GroupService interfaces and implementations exist
  - Identify the location of existing organization and group service code
  - Document current service initialization patterns in main.go
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 2. Create missing service implementations if needed

  - [ ] 2.1 Implement OrganizationService if missing

    - Create organization service interface if not exists
    - Implement concrete organization service with required methods
    - Add proper error handling and validation
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6_

  - [ ] 2.2 Implement GroupService if missing
    - Create group service interface if not exists
    - Implement concrete group service with required methods
    - Add proper error handling and validation
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.6_

- [x] 3. Fix service initialization in main.go

  - Add organization service initialization to initializeServer function
  - Add group service initialization to initializeServer function
  - Ensure proper dependency injection for repositories and other services
  - Add error handling for service initialization failures
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 4. Update route setup to include organization routes

  - Modify SetupAAA function in internal/routes/setup.go to call SetupOrganizationRoutes
  - Pass required services (orgService, groupService) to organization route setup
  - Add proper error handling for missing service dependencies
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 5. Fix organization handler initialization

  - Update setupRoutesAndDocs function to initialize organization handler
  - Pass organization handler to route setup functions
  - Ensure proper dependency injection for all required services
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 4.1, 4.3_

- [ ] 6. Verify permission routes are properly registered

  - Check that SetupPermissionRoutes is being called correctly
  - Verify permission handler has all required dependencies
  - Fix any missing service dependencies for permission routes
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 7. Add comprehensive error handling

  - Add validation for required services before route registration
  - Implement graceful degradation for optional services
  - Add clear error messages for missing dependencies
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 8. Test route accessibility
  - Write integration tests to verify organization endpoints return proper responses
  - Write integration tests to verify permission endpoints return proper responses
  - Test authentication and authorization work correctly on all routes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_
