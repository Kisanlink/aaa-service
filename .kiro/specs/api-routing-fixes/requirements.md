# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AAA service has organization and permissions APIs that are returning 404 errors because the routes are not properly registered in the main server setup. The organization routes are defined in `internal/routes/organization_routes.go` and permission routes in `internal/routes/permission_routes.go`, but they are not being called from the main route setup function. This needs to be fixed systematically to ensure all API endpoints are accessible.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to access organization management endpoints, so that I can create, read, update, and delete organizations through the REST API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I make a GET request to `/api/v1/organizations` THEN the system SHALL return a list of organizations
2. WHEN I make a POST request to `/api/v1/organizations` with valid data THEN the system SHALL create a new organization
3. WHEN I make a GET request to `/api/v1/organizations/{id}` THEN the system SHALL return the specific organization
4. WHEN I make a PUT request to `/api/v1/organizations/{id}` with valid data THEN the system SHALL update the organization
5. WHEN I make a DELETE request to `/api/v1/organizations/{id}` THEN the system SHALL delete the organization
6. WHEN I make requests to organization hierarchy endpoints THEN the system SHALL return appropriate responses

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to access permission management endpoints, so that I can manage permissions through the REST API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I make a GET request to `/api/v1/permissions` THEN the system SHALL return a list of permissions
2. WHEN I make a POST request to `/api/v1/permissions` with valid data THEN the system SHALL create a new permission
3. WHEN I access permission endpoints THEN the system SHALL enforce proper authentication and authorization

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the route registration to be systematic and maintainable, so that new routes can be easily added without missing registration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new route files are created THEN they SHALL be automatically included in the main setup
2. WHEN the server starts THEN all defined routes SHALL be registered and accessible
3. WHEN route handlers are missing dependencies THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN routes require services THEN the system SHALL properly initialize and inject those services

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling for missing services, so that I can identify and fix configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN required services are not initialized THEN the system SHALL log clear error messages
2. WHEN route registration fails THEN the system SHALL prevent server startup
3. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on what needs to be configured
