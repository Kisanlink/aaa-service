# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the current 404 errors for organization-related routes by implementing a comprehensive organization routing and hierarchy system. The system will enable multi-tenant organization management with configurable groups, user group assignments, role assignments to groups, and hierarchical group structures. This will provide the technical foundation to host any organization on the network with proper isolation and access control.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want organization routes to be properly wired and accessible, so that I can manage organizations without encountering 404 errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is made to any organization endpoint THEN the system SHALL route the request to the appropriate handler
2. WHEN accessing `/api/v1/organizations` THEN the system SHALL return a valid response instead of 404
3. WHEN accessing organization-specific endpoints THEN the system SHALL properly resolve the organization context
4. IF an organization route is not implemented THEN the system SHALL return a meaningful error message instead of 404

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an organization administrator, I want to create and manage hierarchical group structures within my organization, so that I can organize users according to my business structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a group THEN the system SHALL allow specifying a parent group to create hierarchies
2. WHEN a group has child groups THEN the system SHALL maintain the parent-child relationships
3. WHEN querying group hierarchies THEN the system SHALL return the complete tree structure
4. WHEN deleting a parent group THEN the system SHALL handle child group reassignment or cascading deletion
5. IF a circular hierarchy is attempted THEN the system SHALL reject the operation with an appropriate error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an organization administrator, I want to assign users to groups within my organization, so that I can control access based on organizational structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assigning a user to a group THEN the system SHALL create the user-group relationship within the organization context
2. WHEN a user belongs to multiple groups THEN the system SHALL maintain all group memberships
3. WHEN removing a user from a group THEN the system SHALL only affect that specific group membership
4. WHEN querying user group memberships THEN the system SHALL return all groups the user belongs to within the organization
5. IF a user is assigned to a non-existent group THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an organization administrator, I want to assign roles to groups, so that all members of a group automatically inherit the group's permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assigning a role to a group THEN the system SHALL apply that role to all current and future group members
2. WHEN a user joins a group THEN the system SHALL automatically grant them the group's assigned roles
3. WHEN a user leaves a group THEN the system SHALL remove the group-inherited roles from that user
4. WHEN a role is removed from a group THEN the system SHALL remove that role from all group members
5. IF role inheritance conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL resolve them using a defined precedence order

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an organization administrator, I want bi-directional hierarchical role inheritance, so that parents inherit from children (like a CEO knowing what employees can do) and children inherit from parents in the organizational structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user belongs to a parent group THEN the system SHALL grant them roles from all descendant groups in the hierarchy
2. WHEN a user belongs to a child group THEN the system SHALL grant them roles from all ancestor groups in the hierarchy
3. WHEN roles are assigned to any group THEN the system SHALL automatically flow them both upward to ancestors and downward to descendants
4. WHEN calculating effective permissions THEN the system SHALL consider roles from direct groups, ancestor groups, and descendant groups
5. WHEN group hierarchies change THEN the system SHALL recalculate both upward and downward role inheritance for affected users
6. IF role conflicts exist in the hierarchy THEN the system SHALL apply the most specific role first (closest to the user's direct group membership)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to support multi-tenant organization isolation, so that each organization's data and configurations are completely separated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing any organization request THEN the system SHALL enforce organization-level data isolation
2. WHEN an organization administrator manages groups THEN the system SHALL only allow access to groups within their organization
3. WHEN users are assigned to groups THEN the system SHALL ensure both user and group belong to the same organization
4. WHEN querying organization data THEN the system SHALL filter results based on the requesting user's organization context
5. IF cross-organization access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny the request with an appropriate error

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the AAA service, I want comprehensive organization management APIs, so that I can programmatically manage organizational structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the organization API THEN the system SHALL provide CRUD operations for organizations, groups, and relationships
2. WHEN creating organizational structures THEN the system SHALL validate all relationships and constraints
3. WHEN querying organizational data THEN the system SHALL provide efficient endpoints with proper pagination
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return consistent, meaningful error responses
5. IF bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently with proper transaction management

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want audit logging for all organization-related operations, so that I can track changes and maintain compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any organization structure changes THEN the system SHALL log the operation with full context
2. WHEN group memberships are modified THEN the system SHALL record who made the change and when
3. WHEN role assignments change THEN the system SHALL audit the permission changes with affected users
4. WHEN querying audit logs THEN the system SHALL provide organization-scoped audit trails
5. IF sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL ensure audit logs cannot be tampered with
