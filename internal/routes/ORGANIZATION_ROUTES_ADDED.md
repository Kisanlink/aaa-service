# Organization Routes Extension - Task 2 Implementation

## Summary

Extended `internal/routes/organization_routes.go` with organization-scoped group management endpoints as specified in the design document.

## Routes Added

### Organization-scoped Group Management Routes

- `GET /:orgId/groups` - List organization groups
- `POST /:orgId/groups` - Create group in organization
- `GET /:orgId/groups/:groupId` - Get group details
- `PUT /:orgId/groups/:groupId` - Update group
- `DELETE /:orgId/groups/:groupId` - Delete group
- `GET /:orgId/groups/:groupId/hierarchy` - Get group hierarchy

### User-Group Management within Organization Context

- `POST /:orgId/groups/:groupId/users` - Add user to group
- `DELETE /:orgId/groups/:groupId/users/:userId` - Remove user from group
- `GET /:orgId/groups/:groupId/users` - List group users
- `GET /:orgId/users/:userId/groups` - Get user's groups

### Role-Group Management within Organization Context

- `POST /:orgId/groups/:groupId/roles` - Assign role to group
- `DELETE /:orgId/groups/:groupId/roles/:roleId` - Remove role from group
- `GET /:orgId/groups/:groupId/roles` - List group roles
- `GET /:orgId/users/:userId/effective-roles` - Get user's effective roles

## Implementation Details

### Middleware Integration

- All new routes use `authMiddleware.HTTPAuthMiddleware()` for authentication
- Consistent with existing organization route patterns
- Applied to both v1 and v2 API versions

### Parameter Extraction

- Routes support proper parameter extraction for `orgId`, `groupId`, `userId`, `roleId`
- Parameter naming follows existing codebase conventions
- Tested parameter extraction patterns in test file

### Route Registration

- Routes are registered in both `/api/v1` and `/api/v1` groups
- Maintains consistency with existing organization routes
- Proper route grouping and organization

## Requirements Satisfied

- **1.1**: Organization routes properly wired and accessible
- **1.2**: Organization-specific endpoints resolve organization context
- **1.3**: Proper route resolution for organization endpoints
- **7.1**: Comprehensive organization management APIs with CRUD operations

## Next Steps

The routes are now properly registered and will be ready for handler implementation in subsequent tasks. Handler methods need to be implemented in the organization handler to make these routes functional.

## Files Modified

- `internal/routes/organization_routes.go` - Extended with new group management routes
- `internal/routes/organization_routes_test.go` - Added parameter extraction tests
- `internal/routes/ORGANIZATION_ROUTES_ADDED.md` - This documentation file
