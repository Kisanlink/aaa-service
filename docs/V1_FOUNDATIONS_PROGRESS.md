# V1 Foundations - Implementation Progress

## M1.1 - Core Database Schema (✅ Completed)

### Overview
Created comprehensive database models to support the new AAA service architecture with support for:
- Organizations with hierarchy
- Groups with time-bounded membership and inheritance
- Enhanced roles with GLOBAL/ORG scope and versioning
- Flexible bindings with JSONB caveats
- Column-level authorization with bitmap operations
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Immutable event chain with hash verification

### New Models Created

#### 1. **Organization** (`organization.go`)
- Hierarchical organization structure
- Parent-child relationships
- Metadata support for extensibility

#### 2. **Groups** (`group.go`)
- **Group**: Named collections that can own roles/policies
- **GroupMembership**: Time-bounded membership with starts_at/ends_at
- **GroupInheritance**: Group-to-group inheritance with time bounds
- Support for both user and service principals

#### 3. **Enhanced Roles** (`role.go` - updated)
- Added scope (GLOBAL/ORG) support
- Organization-specific roles
- Version tracking for rollback capability
- Hierarchical role relationships maintained

#### 4. **Principals** (`principal.go`)
- Unified identity model for users and services
- **Principal**: Abstract identity type
- **Service**: Service account with API key authentication
- Links to User model for user principals

#### 5. **Bindings** (`binding.go`)
- Core authorization binding model
- Supports role or permission bindings
- JSONB caveat field for flexible constraints:
  - Time-based access (`starts_at`, `ends_at`)
  - Attribute requirements (`required_attributes`)
  - Column restrictions (`column_groups`)
- **BindingHistory**: Full audit trail of binding changes

#### 6. **Column Authorization** (`column_group.go`)
- **ColumnGroup**: Named groups of columns (e.g., "pii_basic", "finance")
- **ColumnGroupMember**: Individual column memberships
- **ColumnSet**: Bitmap representation for efficient operations
- Bitwise operations: Union, Intersect, IsSubsetOf
- Scalable to hundreds of columns per table

#### 7. **Attributes** (`attribute.go`)
- Key-value attributes for ABAC
- Support for principals, resources, and organizations
- Time-based expiration
- **AttributeHistory**: Change tracking
- Type-safe value setters/getters
- **AttributeRegistry**: In-memory cache structure

#### 8. **Events** (`event.go`)
- Immutable audit events with hash chain
- SHA256 hash verification
- Previous hash linking for blockchain-style integrity
- **EventCheckpoint**: Periodic Merkle tree checkpoints
- Comprehensive event types for all system actions
- Request tracking metadata (IP, user agent, request ID)

### Database Migration Updates
- Updated `SqlDB.go` to include all new models
- Organized migrations by logical groupings:
  - Core identity models
  - Organization and groups
  - Roles and permissions
  - Resources
  - Bindings
  - Column-level authorization
  - Attributes for ABAC
  - Audit and events

### SpiceDB Schema V2
Created new schema file (`spicedb_schema_v2.zed`) with:
- Organization hierarchy with ownership
- Groups with membership and inheritance
- Enhanced user/service definitions
- Role assignments with time bounds
- Resource hierarchy with role-based relations
- Table resources with column-level caveats
- Comprehensive permission model
- Three caveat types:
  - `within_time`: Time-bounded access
  - `has_attributes`: Attribute-based constraints
  - `has_columns`: Column-level restrictions

### Key Design Decisions

1. **JSONB Caveats**: Used flexible JSONB format for caveats to allow easy extension without schema changes
2. **Bitmap Operations**: Implemented efficient bitmap operations for column sets to handle tables with hundreds of columns
3. **Time Bounds**: Pervasive time-bounded access across groups, memberships, and attributes
4. **Hash Chain**: Implemented blockchain-style hash chain for tamper-proof audit trail
5. **Unified Principals**: Abstract principal model to treat users and services uniformly in bindings

### Next Steps (M1.2)
- Implement gRPC service definitions
- Create HTTP gateway configuration
- Seed static actions in the database
- Set up proto file compilation pipeline

## Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Bitmap operations for column sets are O(1) for most operations
- JSONB indexes can be added for caveat queries
- Event hash computation is deterministic and efficient
- Principal model allows for efficient permission checks

### Security Features
- Hash chain ensures audit log integrity
- Time-bounded access reduces risk of stale permissions
- Column-level authorization prevents data leakage
- Service accounts have separate authentication flow

### Extensibility
- JSONB fields throughout for metadata and future extensions
- Caveat system designed to support new constraint types
- Event system can handle new event types without schema changes
- Attribute system supports arbitrary key-value pairs
